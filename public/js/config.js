var SAMPLE_TEXT2 = "It may be a gadget, but it is the best gadget I have ever owned. ZZZ has only missed a few words and that was because I wasn't speaking clearly. I love that it plays the music and playlists I have uploaded to YYY. I have used and love the shopping list feature, which works great with the cell phone app. It is a handy and time saving feature. The remote control is terrific. There is a multitude of things you can do with the XXX that will make your life more protective and enjoyable. Be creative and take the time to explore all the possibilities and I think this device will be amazing to you as well.\n"+
"I love this device.  It has been a lifesaver following my husbands' surgery by being able to set multiple timers, playing music, answering questions, etc.  I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he didn't think he would like it.  After using it for a day, he is hooked and ZZZ is now a member of our household.\n"+
"I was an early adopter getting in on the $99.00 price. I am very impressed with how responsive the YYY XXX team is with our requests and feedback. I also created the community on Google plus called 'How to use the YYY XXX' for people like me that own one or wanting one. I know it is developing and I am fine with that as along as they keep improving it. The speaker is fine for moderate listening levels and great for books on tape or the news.\n"+
"This device was a fun way to connect my Pandora and other music choices together as well as get on the spot news/weather reports. But it stopped functioning 2 weeks over the warranty and YYY said too bad so sad. Oh well I will not be buying another.\n"+
"XXX is a decent bluetooth speaker.   But for 199, you could find a better bluetooth speaker.   The voice recognition is fair to poor.   And the most frustrating part is that it can't play much of the YYY content - no Audible, no Kindle, and it can't recognize much of the YYY Prime library (other than the same 50 songs over and over  So, you are left with using it as a bluetooth speaker paired to your phone/tablet.\n"+
"ZZZ is a fascinating idea, but unfortunately YYY released it to the public without fully checking out its capabilities!  Tried to download all my ITunes ( at $25. bucks per year) and only half of my songs downloaded!  Called YYY and they offered to give me a $30 credit to buy the songs that didn't appear, but I am missing over 300 songs!!!! I told them to forget it and just cancel my subscription.  Much to YYY's credit, they told me they will try to solve this problem for me!  It's got to get better and you will love it!  Meanwhile, you have to deal with this product taking baby steps...hopefully it will be walking soon!\n"+
"I got it in January, I would return it if I could. Unpredictable results, one day works like a charm, the next day it won't connect to the cloud. Given the chance, I would look for other alternatives.\n"+
"I might as well use my laptop or phone's voice recognition to get information.  The reason I bought this was mostly to get quick answers to questions I had.  I'm totally disappointed with it's ability to give answers to simple questions.  I asked 'When are the Tony Awards' and several times it came up with an answer like, 'sorry, I do not know the answer to your question.  I had my wife ask the same question with the same response'.\n"+
"Was excited to get my XXX today.  For the most part it worked well with realistic expectations.  Was extremely disappointed that there are no parental controls on this thing since it is advertised as a family product.  Imagine the surprise of parents everywhere where the voice recognition (which is not expected to be perfect) misunderstands a child's request, says the song has explicit lyrics, then belts out a harmonious string of obscenities to their six year child.  The advertisements on YYY's site shows a child using it with her parents, so why the huge oversight?  Think about all the song parodies out there - even if the voice recognition was perfect, the chances of it blasting out something explicit is pretty good.  In my opinion, the size of YYY's bank account was more important to them than providing a quality, well thought out product.  Both the Prime Music and XXX teams need to take a stroll down the hall and learn something from their Prime Video team mates.  Called YYY customer support about this and they suggested to press the button that disables the microphone - what's the point of owning one then????  Just like Prime Music, I don't see how anyone could recommend this product for any household with children - unless the parents in the household don't care what is listened to.\n"+
"The voice recognition is disappointing. I use another program for voice to text applications which works 10 times better than XXX at voice recognition right out of the box without training. As far as information XXX seems to be dumber than a box of hammers. The most often heard refrain is, 'I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question.' for even the simplest of questions like how tall is the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. It also often tells you to go to the XXX app and click on the Bing search link and enter your question there. That is why I have the XXX. So I don't need to stop and type stuff into a computer. It is also not very current. I live in the State of Quintana Roo in Mexico and we changed time to EST on Feb. 1st and ZZZ is still quoting CST when asked the time. I am not impressed that the unit has to remain plugged in all the time. Rechargeable batteries would make it so much more convenient but I am sure there is a price and size consideration involved there. On the other hand the music function is fabulous. The speaker system is superb for such a small small unit and I love being able to change volume and artists with a simple voice command. The microphone sensitivity is amazing. All in all the unit is worth the discounted price of $99 just for the music function alone but the other features have a long way to go. In case you are wondering I am a native English speaker born and raised in the United States so the voice recognition problem is not because of accent."

var SAMPLE_TEXT = "Usually, I am a huge fan of Westville and go pretty often. However my last trip with three of my good friends at 8:30 ended on a rough note. After enjoying our wine, meal, and desert they tell us that the credit card machine is not working and that it would only take a few extra minutes to go through. We continued to sit and talk thinking we would be out of the restaurant no later than 10. Almost an hour goes by and still the machine is broken. At that point our waitress and manager tried to push us to walk down the street to go to the ATM and take out cash. This made things very complicated because only two of us had an ATM card, while the other two had a credit card. The other option they gave us was to write down our credit card information and charge us when the machine started working. IN NO WAY would I want to leave that information with a stranger for them to use freely. At that point we all became very frustrated. Finally at 11pm (this is also a week day that all four of us have full time jobs) one of us gives up and goes down the street in the cold to take out cash. I am extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service. Not only did the staff not seem empathetic or apologetic, but there was nothing done for us as a result of us waiting. They could have easily comped the drinks we ordered, or the desert. But nothing. After waiting for an hour for your card to go through SOMETHING should have been done. Instead we kept hearing  there is nothing we can do  and  it isn't our fault.  In my opinion and experience, restaurants should put the customer first, being mindful of their time and energy. Additionally, I work in customer service and I would have handled the situation completely differently. I would have offered a round of drinks while my customers waited, given a gift card as an apology. SOMETHING to ensure that my customers know how much they are valued. I am saddened that this terrible experience will stop me from going to one of my favorite spots in the city.\n" + 
"Thought I would come for dinner considering the very good reviews and the huge crowd in the week ends, but was much disappointed. We came in and sat at a table of two, the setting was nice. But then, they let a homeless person seat next to us. He just sat there for 15mn listening to his music and trying to talk to people, and not ordering anything. His presence was highly awkward... The waiters did not say anything or try to come pick an eventual order, and he left 15mn after. We then got our food and were pretty disappointed. the  special  pork tacos were completely cold, so we had them go back to the kitchen. They did not offer to keep my plate warm for 10mn and bring back the plates together. My marinated chicken was fine, but nothing exceptional, and I was forced to start eating because it was starting to be cold. I was almost done when the tacos plate of my mate came by and was cold once again... We left and bought a pack of M&Ms for dessert...\n" +

"cobb salad was the worst thing ive ever had. lettuce was salty and the chicken and bacon were hard as rocks. the blue cheese was super salty. none of that went well together- it was gross. the gazpacho soup was watery and spicy and nasty, could finish more than a few bites of both. FREAKING GROSS FOOD! plus the staff are inattentive and the glasses are super dirty...told him about it and i got the same glass back without the dry lipstick all over...except it was still on the rim....wth....not rude but definitely made me feel bad that he had to get me a new glass...thats not how customers should feel fyi. the space was just not very nice...\n" + 
"Sorry to say that I was disappointed meal overall. My friend suggested this place and I've always passed by it walking around the East Village. It's always busy here so expect a wait on a popular night. For starters, my friend and I ordered a platter of 4 vegetables--broccoli, bok choy, brussel sprouts, and green beans. I probably enjoyed the broccoli and green beans the most. The broccoli wasn't too special, but I definitely recommend the green beans--nice flavor and not overcooked (i.e., not soggy). I'm not a big fan of brussel sprouts and these did not make me like them--tasted bitter like it was undercooked. The bok choy just tasted like someone just got lazy and dosed it in hoisin sauce--not at all pleasing and I love my bok choy. I ordered the fish and chips because I was in a fish and chips kind of mood. The chips aka fries were fine. The fried fish filet--very odd flavor. The batter tasted like there was too much vinegar or something. The tartar sauce helped to mask the weird flavor, but it was still a struggle to finish my food. Service: Went here on a Sunday night and there was a slight wait. The servers were fine. I think most people enjoy Westville, at least the East Village location, because it's kind of an open space. Some seating outside and the windows are open so patrons can enjoy the fresh air.\n" + 
"This place is raved about - and serves great good - but the cleanliness and the service is terrible. I ordered in a salmon salad and I found the root of the lettuce inside my salad including all the mud etc. When I called they didn't believe me, asked to pickup the salad and only refunded me for the salad portion of my meal, not even the add-on for salmon! I can't begin to think about the kitchen as it must be so dark in their that they couldn't have seen it in the first place.\n" + 
"This place a little cute corner restaurant in Alphabet City. We went on a Sunday early afternoon, so expect a wait time. The hostess was so great! She really made an effort to get our table of 4 sat as quickly as possible. Our waitress was also incredible! She was very sweet and patient, and seemed to really know the menu. The Health Tea was good! It has fresh mint, lemon, ginger and a cinnamon stick- something I will definitely try at home. I ordered the Egg Scramble with Chorizo, Goat Cheese & Tomato. It comes with potato hash and toast. It was okay... I wish I had ordered the Brunch Special Rice Bowl or the Market Plate (which my friends let me try). Those were incredible. I will definitely be back for that Market Plate!\n" + 
"Omg! This is my new favorite place in alphabet city. Went here last night with one of my friends and was worried about it because I wanted to make sure they had some healthy stuff on the menu. Turns out I had NOTHING to be worried about, because 75% of the menu is healthy and delicious! I ordered the salmon with broccoli and greenbeans. Great portions :) the service was awesome too, as our waiter was very kind and gave great recommendations. Will be back again!\n" + 
"I wish i could give Westville East a better rating because I really liked my experience at the west village location, but doing so would be dishonest. with more space and a more accessible location (for me at least), i wanted to love westville east, but instead, my experience led me to question whether or not i ever really loved either location in the first place.\n" + 
"Oh Westville East, I love you and hate you so much...There's a lot to love about Westville; lots of healthy and tasty food options, market sides (I love that you can make a bunch of sides into a meal), well balanced menu, cute restaurant interior, delivery is fast half of the time. There's also a lot to hate; you will always have to wait to sit at the restaurant, the restaurant is extremely cramped, delivery takes forever half of the time, the food is pricey. Although I really don't love everything about this place, I am addicted to their beets, artichokes, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and plantains. I can't stop wanting these items and no one else does it as good, or will serve this all to me on the same plate... So I guess I'm just going to keep coming back FOREVER.\n"

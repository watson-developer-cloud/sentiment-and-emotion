var SAMPLE_TEXT = "It may be a gadget, but it is the best gadget I have ever owned. Alexa has only missed a few words and that was because I wasn't speaking clearly. I love that it plays the music and playlists I have uploaded to Amazon. I have used and love the shopping list feature, which works great with the cell phone app. It is a handy and time saving feature. The remote control is terrific. There is a multitude of things you can do with the Echo that will make your life more protective and enjoyable. Be creative and take the time to explore all the possibilities and I think this device will be amazing to you as well.\n"+
"I love this device.  It has been a lifesaver following my husbands' surgery by being able to set multiple timers, playing music, answering questions, etc.  I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he didn't think he would like it.  After using it for a day, he is hooked and Alexa is now a member of our household.\n"+
"I was an early adopter getting in on the $99.00 price. I am very impressed with how responsive the Amazon Echo team is with our requests and feedback. I also created the community on Google plus called 'How to use the Amazon Echo' for people like me that own one or wanting one. I know it is developing and I am fine with that as along as they keep improving it. The speaker is fine for moderate listening levels and great for books on tape or the news.\n"+
"This device was a fun way to connect my Pandora and other music choices together as well as get on the spot news/weather reports. But it stopped functioning 2 weeks over the warranty and Amazon said too bad so sad. Oh well I will not be buying another.\n"+
"Echo is a decent bluetooth speaker.   But for 199, you could find a better bluetooth speaker.   The voice recognition is fair to poor.   And the most frustrating part is that it can't play much of the Amazon content - no Audible, no Kindle, and it can't recognize much of the Amazon Prime library (other than the same 50 songs over and over  So, you are left with using it as a bluetooth speaker paired to your phone/tablet.\n"+
"Alexa is a fascinating idea, but unfortunately Amazon released it to the public without fully checking out its capabilities!  Tried to download all my ITunes ( at $25. bucks per year) and only half of my songs downloaded!  Called Amazon and they offered to give me a $30 credit to buy the songs that didn't appear, but I am missing over 300 songs!!!! I told them to forget it and just cancel my subscription.  Much to Amazon's credit, they told me they will try to solve this problem for me!  It's got to get better and you will love it!  Meanwhile, you have to deal with this product taking baby steps...hopefully it will be walking soon!\n"+
"I got it in January, I would return it if I could. Unpredictable results, one day works like a charm, the next day it won't connect to the cloud. Given the chance, I would look for other alternatives.\n"+
"I might as well use my laptop or phone's voice recognition to get information.  The reason I bought this was mostly to get quick answers to questions I had.  I'm totally disappointed with it's ability to give answers to simple questions.  I asked 'When are the Tony Awards' and several times it came up with an answer like, 'sorry, I do not know the answer to your question.  I had my wife ask the same question with the same response'.\n"+
"Was excited to get my echo today.  For the most part it worked well with realistic expectations.  Was extremely disappointed that there are no parental controls on this thing since it is advertised as a family product.  Imagine the surprise of parents everywhere where the voice recognition (which is not expected to be perfect) misunderstands a child's request, says the song has explicit lyrics, then belts out a harmonious string of obscenities to their six year child.  The advertisements on Amazon's site shows a child using it with her parents, so why the huge oversight?  Think about all the song parodies out there - even if the voice recognition was perfect, the chances of it blasting out something explicit is pretty good.  In my opinion, the size of Amazon's bank account was more important to them than providing a quality, well thought out product.  Both the Prime Music and Echo teams need to take a stroll down the hall and learn something from their Prime Video team mates.  Called Amazon customer support about this and they suggested to press the button that disables the microphone - what's the point of owning one then????  Just like Prime Music, I don't see how anyone could recommend this product for any household with children - unless the parents in the household don't care what is listened to.\n"+
"The voice recognition is disappointing. I use another program for voice to text applications which works 10 times better than Echo at voice recognition right out of the box without training. As far as information Echo seems to be dumber than a box of hammers. The most often heard refrain is, 'I'm sorry, I don't have the answer to that question.' for even the simplest of questions like how tall is the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. It also often tells you to go to the echo app and click on the Bing search link and enter your question there. That is why I have the Echo. So I don't need to stop and type stuff into a computer. It is also not very current. I live in the State of Quintana Roo in Mexico and we changed time to EST on Feb. 1st and Alexa is still quoting CST when asked the time. I am not impressed that the unit has to remain plugged in all the time. Rechargeable batteries would make it so much more convenient but I am sure there is a price and size consideration involved there. On the other hand the music function is fabulous. The speaker system is superb for such a small small unit and I love being able to change volume and artists with a simple voice command. The microphone sensitivity is amazing. All in all the unit is worth the discounted price of $99 just for the music function alone but the other features have a long way to go. In case you are wondering I am a native English speaker born and raised in the United States so the voice recognition problem is not because of accent."
